# classes_Python_Bq_computacional

These are lectures about Python programming taught at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, in the course _Computational Biochemistry_ of the Biochemistry Undergraduate Program.

This course is broadly divided into three main parts:

- Introductory concepts on Python programming
- Structured text processing and information extraction. Examples are mainly "structured texts" from Bioinformatics.
- Pyhton modules for scientific computation.
